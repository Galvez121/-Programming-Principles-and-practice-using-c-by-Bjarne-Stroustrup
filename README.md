# -Programming-Principles-and-practice-using-c++-by-Bjarne-Stroustrup
I wanted to have my solutions for the Exercises from the book " Programming Principles and practice using c++" by Bjarne Stroustrup. 

I will share my code little by little as I progress through the book.

# Ch 5 and 6
I have finished chapters 5 and 6 so far (02/27/2026).In chapter 5, I learned how a program is built from grammar and how it is translated into functions, tokenization, and error handling.Then, chapter 6 talks more about completing the program; things like cleaning up the code and how to make the code extensible and maintainable. 

Many concepts were introduced in these two chapters, but instead of focusing on why it works, I think this part of the book is designed to teach the reader more about the software engineering part.
